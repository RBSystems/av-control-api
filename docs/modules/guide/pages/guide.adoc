= Guide

This setup guide should help you get your first room up and running, using the av-control-api to control it and optionally one of our UI's. The basic sections are as follows:
. Getting the OS ready
. Downloading/starting the av-control-api docker containers and (optionally) a basic UI container
. Setting up the database and configuring your devices
. Testing the API

By the end of this guide, you'll have a basic room working and ready for you to play with.
