Drivers are the services that the av-api calls to talk to physical AV devices.
We write/use https://github.com/byuoitav/nec-driver[libraries] that implement one of the interfaces in this package - which interface they implement depends on the type of device the driver is written for.

Subdirectories of this package are all of our BYU-specific driver servers, which are compiled into docker containers based on the link:nec/dockerfile[`dockerfile`] (and the link:nec/dockerfile-arm[`dockerfile-arm`] for arm containers).

== Writing a Driver
. Create a new repo, titled with the control protocol or vendor `-driver`.
.. Use the github provided Go `.gitignore`.
.. Repos from BYU OIT AV should use the https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache 2.0 License]

. Initialize https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules[go mod] by running `go mod init <github.com/org/repo>`
+
IMPORTANT: All new repos should use go mod. Make sure to clone your repo outside of your `$GOPATH`.

. Create a struct in your new package that will implement to appropriate interface. Its fields should be an data required to use the driver.
+
[source,go]
----
package adcp <1>

type Projector struct {
	Username string <2>
	Password string <2>
}
----
<1> A driver library should typically have only one package
<2> Not required, just an example

. Implement all of the required functions in the matching interface found in this package. For example, to make a projector driver, you would probably want to implement the interface found in link:display.go[`display.go`].
+
[source,go]
----
func (p *Projector) GetPower(ctx context.Context, addr string) (string, error) { <1>
}
----
<1> Confused with context? These articles are a great place to start: https://blog.golang.org/context[1], https://dave.cheney.net/2017/08/20/context-isnt-for-cancellation[2], https://dave.cheney.net/2017/01/26/context-is-for-cancelation[3]
+
CAUTION: Make sure that your driver library has good test code to ensure future changes don't break things. ðŸ˜Š

. Once a working version of your library is ready, release a v1.0.0 version of it. For future releases, use https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] to denote changes.
[source,bash]
----
$ git tag -a "v1.0.0"
$ git push --tags
----

== Making a Driver Server
Once you have finished a library, or want to use one that implements one of the driver interfaces, you create create a driver server.

. Create a subdirectory in this one with the name of your driver server. Usually, this should match the driver name, without the `-driver` suffix.

. In your new directory, initalize go mod by running `go mod init github.com/byuoitav/drivers/<folder name>`
+
TIP: In this case, go mod is used to reliably import the correct version of external libraries, and not for exporting your package.

. TODO adding dockerfile, anything else https://github.com/bwinterton needs to build these

. Create a `server.go` file. This is where all of your driver server's code should go.
+
[source,go]
----
package main // // <1>

// imports

func main() { <1>
    var port int
    // variable declarations

    pflag.IntVarP(&port, "port", "p", 80, "port to run the server on") <2>
    // other flags

    pflag.Parse() <3>

    // create a net.Listener to run the server on
    addr := fmt.Sprintf(":%d", port)
    lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", addr)
    if err != nil {
        // handle err
    }

    // import driver library
    display := &adcp.Projector{} <4>

    // create server
    server := drivers.CreateDisplayServer(display) <5>
    if err = server.Serve(lis); err != nil {
        // handle err
    }
}
----
<1> Must be in package `main` with a `main()` function. This is where your driver server will start.
<2> The port to run our servers will be passed in as part of the dockerfile.
<3> We use the https://github.com/spf13/pflag[pflag] library for POSIX style flags.
<4> The variable, package, and struct name will change depending on the driver you are importing.
<5> Use the correct `Create...Server()` function for the interface your driver implements.
